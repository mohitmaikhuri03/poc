## Introduction

Logs monitoring is an essential part of any modern system. It helps developers and DevOps engineers detect issues, debug errors, and monitor the overall health of their systems in real-time.

This document describes how we can build a basic logs monitoring system using **Grafana**, **Promtail**, and **Loki** — all open-source tools by Grafana Labs.

## What is Logs Monitoring?

Logs monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and displaying logs from different servers, applications, or services. It helps in identifying issues, performance bottlenecks, and unexpected behavior.

You can think of it like a **CCTV for your servers** – you can see what happened, when it happened, and where it went wrong.

## Why is Logs Monitoring Important?

- 🐛 **Debugging:** Helps identify and fix issues quickly.
- ⏱️ **Real-time alerts:** Monitor log data in real time.
- 🧠 **Insights:** Understand system behavior and trends.
- 🚨 **Incident detection:** Get notified on unusual patterns or errors.
- 📊 **Visualization:** See logs in dashboards and graphs for better analysis.

## Tools Used

| Tool       | Role                            | Description                                                                 |
|------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Grafana** | Dashboard & Visualization        | Used to build dashboards and visualize log data collected from Loki.       |
| **Loki**    | Logs Aggregator (like log DB)    | A log aggregation system optimized for quick querying of logs.             |
| **Promtail**| Log Collector & Shipper          | Runs on servers, collects log files, and sends them to Loki for storage.   |

## How It Works

1. **Promtail** is installed on the server where logs are generated.
2. It reads logs from files like `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/nginx/access.log`, etc.
3. Promtail then **pushes** these logs to **Loki**.
4. **Loki** stores these logs efficiently and allows querying.
5. **Grafana** connects to Loki and displays logs in a visual format like tables, graphs, or alert panels.

---

## Steps to Setup

### 1. Install Promtail
- Download Promtail from the [official releases](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases)
- Configure the `promtail.yaml` to specify the paths of log files and Loki URL
- Start the service

### 2. Install Loki
- Loki can run as a single binary or inside Docker
- Minimal configuration needed in `loki-config.yaml`
- Start the Loki server

### 3. Setup Grafana
- Download and install Grafana
- Add **Loki** as a data source
- Import or create dashboards to display logs

### 4. Visualize Logs
- Use Grafana’s **Explore** tab to search logs
- Use filters, labels, and queries to drill down into logs
- Set up alerts to notify on errors or custom log patterns

## Conclusion and Recommendation

This PoC (Proof of Concept) shows how logs monitoring can be done using open-source tools. It is simple, scalable, and easy to manage.

> ✅ **Recommended Setup**:  
> Use **Promtail → Loki → Grafana** for lightweight, cost-effective, and efficient logs monitoring.  
> Suitable for both **development** and **production** environments.

> ⚠️ **Tips**:
> - Always label your logs (e.g., app name, environment, instance).
> - Use retention policies in Loki to manage storage.
> - Integrate alerts in Grafana for quick detection.
